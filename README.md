# BetterQuesting

A new and improved questing mod for Minecraft pack creators

## This fork

The Supersymmetry team had created this fork to incorporate changes from
[GTNewHorizons/BetterQuesting#89](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/BetterQuesting/pull/89) into the 1.12.2 version of
BetterQuesting. Further improvements are planned in the future.

## Upstream README

This fork is a continuation of Better Questing for Minecraft 1.12.2 from where @Funwayguy stopped development.

The aim of this fork is to provide various improvements and bugfixes over the final state of the mod.

As such, this mod integrates the various addon packs into one main mod, to provide a full-featured experience in a single mod.

Credits to:
- @fonnymunkey for various feature from BQTweaker, now integrated to provide a better experience.
- The Gregtech New Horizons development team for their work on their 1.7.10 fork of Better Questing, whose improvements have been integrated into this fork.
